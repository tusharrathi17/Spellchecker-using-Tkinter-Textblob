# Spellchecker-using-Tkinter-Textblob
The Spelling Checker project aims to develop a user-friendly spell checking tool that helps users identify 
and correct misspelled words in their text. By leveraging the power of Python, Tkinter for GUI development, 
and the TextBlob library for spell checking, this project provides a seamless and efficient solution for improving 
the accuracy of written content. 
The spell checker's main functionality revolves around real-time spell checking and error identification. 
Users can input their text through a graphical user interface, and the spell checker performs instant analysis, 
highlighting any misspelled words. This real-time feedback enables users to correct errors as they type, resulting 
in improved writing accuracy and efficiency.The Spelling Checker project offers extensibility by allowing users 
to customize the spell checking dataset. By modifying or adding entries in an external file, users can adapt the 
spell checker to their specific vocabulary and needs. This feature enhances the project's versatility and ensures 
its usefulness across various domains and writing styles
